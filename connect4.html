    <h3>Here is the java code for a Connect 4 game for two players. Below is a short descroiption of how it works:</h3>
    <h5>Connect 4 is a game of 2 players where the goal is connecting 4 four of your chips (Xs or 0s) vertically, horizontally or diagonally. 
        With each turn, the player chooses a column to drop one of his chips into the 6 by 7 board until connecting four. 
        Each time a column is selected, a chip is dropped, falling above the last cipped dropped in the line. 
        If there are four chips of the same type in a line, the game end. </h5>
